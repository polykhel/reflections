Q: How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

A: So you can easily see your errors and reflect on what you did wrong.

Q: What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

A: You can have more control of your files. 

Q: Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

A: Because these multiple files might be related to one another while in Docs, they are different.

Q: How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

A: Git log will allow me to view the entire history of my commits. It shows the commit ID and commit message.
Git diff will allow me to view the differences of each commits... where lines were inserted and/or deleted...

Q: How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

A: I could just checkout my previous commit like nothing happened. Plus, I can diff the two commits to see where I made a mistake.

Q: Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

A: Version control for all my projects.
